# Known Fixes

## Wrapper script (Sprint 1)

The app command must be `bin/wrapper`, not `bin/pikaraoke`. The snap uses a
wrapper part (dump plugin, source `snap/local`) that stages the wrapper script
into `bin/wrapper`. Direct invocation of the Python entry point fails inside
confinement because environment setup is needed first.

## PYTHONPATH (Sprint 1)

`PYTHONPATH` must be set to `$SNAP/lib/python3.12/site-packages` in the app
environment. Without it the Python interpreter inside the snap cannot find the
installed packages and the application fails to import its own modules.

## Bundled deno runtime

yt-dlp requires a JavaScript runtime to extract download URLs from some sites.
Without one, certain YouTube videos fail during metadata extraction. Deno is
bundled in the snap as `bin/deno` so yt-dlp can invoke it inside the
confinement boundary without relying on the host system.

## Staged libpulse0

The `audio-playback` snap interface provides access to the host PulseAudio
socket, but the PulseAudio client library (`libpulse0`) must still be present
inside the snap for applications to connect. Without it, audio output silently
fails even though the interface is connected.
