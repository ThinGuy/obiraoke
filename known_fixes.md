# Known Fixes

## Bundled deno runtime

yt-dlp requires a JavaScript runtime to extract download URLs from some sites.
Without one, certain YouTube videos fail during metadata extraction. Deno is
bundled in the snap as `bin/deno` so yt-dlp can invoke it inside the
confinement boundary without relying on the host system.

## Staged libpulse0

The `audio-playback` snap interface provides access to the host PulseAudio
socket, but the PulseAudio client library (`libpulse0`) must still be present
inside the snap for applications to connect. Without it, audio output silently
fails even though the interface is connected.
